### Conclusions
* A total of 780 purchases were made for about 183 unique items (generating a total revenue of about $2379.77) indicating that there were a lot of repeat/multiple purchases for the same items.

* The game seems to be more popular among the male players (Of the total 780 purchases, 652 were made by males) and particularly with people in the age range of 20-24. 

* While this demographic seems to spend more than others while purchasing (with an average purchase of 4.32 dollars and 1,114.06 dollars as total purchase value),the players in the 35-39 age range spent the most on average per item. 

* It is interesting to note that even though female and other players make up the minority, they seem to purchase expensive items or spend more on their purchases as their average purchase price per item is higher than those of the male players.

* The most lucrative/profitable items of the game also seem to be the most popular ones, rather than the ones with the lower item price.
